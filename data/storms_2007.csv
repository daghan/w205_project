Most areas of the state had only received 30 to 40 percent of normal annual rainfall by the end of October.  Many lakes and rivers across north and central Georgia were nearing all time record low levels and above ground water supplies were being significantly impacted in many of the larger cities, especially Atlanta.  A number of stream gage locations on creeks and river in north and central Georgia had established new record low water levels during October, including the major river basins of the Coosa, Chattahoochee, upper Oconee, upper Ocmulgee and Flint. Significant water conservation measures were being implemented in many cities across north and central Georgia.||Note, the impact of the drought on crops and the estimated monetary damage was included with the September 2007 Storm Data.

This event occurred within a large stratiform rain shield associated with a tropical disturbance which was later classified as Tropical Storm Barry in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.","A tornado touched down at 1155 EST June 1st along Mira Road on Sugarloaf Key, downing a 30-foot Ficus tree, damaging a screen porch and scattering loose items stored underneath an elevated home.  The tornado likely had an intermittent north northwest path partially over water, before damging a home on Hawksbill Road along the northeast portion of Sugarloaf Key.  An enclosed patio along the back portion of the home had been destroyed, allowing metal covering to peel back on roughly one third of the home. No other homes were damaged, including one across a canal directly in the path of the tornado. Therefore it was concluded the the roof covering failure without any wood roof decking failures occurred due to the failure of the light wood porch.  Heavy rain was noted which also may have caused excessive loads on the screens, contributing to porch failure.  Therefore the maximum damage rating for the entire event was set at EF0.","CSV"

October, climatologically the driest month of the year anyway, fell even short of normal values at most locations in north and central Georgia.  Rainfall deficits of 15 to 20 inches were common in the north and rainfall deficits of 6 to 12 inches were common in central areas.     Most areas of the state had only received 30 to 40 percent of normal annual rainfall by the end of October.  Many lakes and rivers across north and central Georgia were nearing all time record low levels and above ground water supplies were being significantly impacted in many of the larger cities, especially Atlanta.  A number of stream gage locations on creeks and river in north and central Georgia had established new record low water levels during October, including the major river basins of the Coosa, Chattahoochee, upper Oconee, upper Ocmulgee and Flint.

October, climatologically the driest month of the year anyway, fell even short of normal values at most locations in north and central Georgia.  Rainfall deficits of 15 to 20 inches were common in the north and rainfall deficits of 6 to 12 inches were common in central areas.     Most areas of the state had only received 30 to 40 percent of normal annual rainfall by the end of October.  Many lakes and rivers across north and central Georgia were nearing all time record low levels and above ground water supplies were being significantly impacted in many of the larger cities, especially Atlanta.  A number of stream gage locations on creeks and river in north and central Georgia had established new record low water levels during October, including the major river basins of the Coosa, Chattahoochee, upper Oconee, upper Ocmulgee and Flint.

By late on the 8th Georgia State Road 94 and Florida State Road 2 (All one road with two designations) was closed from Moniac, Georgia to Fargo, Georgia due to the threat of the Bugaboo Scrub fire crossing SR 2 and poor visibility because of smoke in the area. By 4:00 p.m. EDT 500 people were evacuated from the vicinity of Taylor, Florida in northern Baker County and others were evacuated near Moniac, Georgia. The focus the fire fighting efforts from May 8th-10th was on structure protection in the Taylor and Baxter, Florida area.  Fire crews, along with private timber companies, were working along the flanks of the fire where conditions allowed, as well as, working to protect structures.

October, climatologically the driest month of the year anyway, fell even short of normal values at most locations in north and central Georgia.  Rainfall deficits of 15 to 20 inches were common in the north and rainfall deficits of 6 to 12 inches were common in central areas.     Most areas of the state had only received 30 to 40 percent of normal annual rainfall by the end of October.  Many lakes and rivers across north and central Georgia were nearing all time record low levels and above ground water supplies were being significantly impacted in many of the larger cities, especially Atlanta.  A number of stream gage locations on creeks and river in north and central Georgia had established new record low water levels during October, including the major river basins of the Coosa, Chattahoochee, upper Oconee, upper Ocmulgee and Flint. Significant water conservation measures were being implemented in many cities across north and central Georgia.||Note, the impact of the drought on crops and the estimated monetary damage was included with the September 2007 Storm Data.  Additional crop losses from September to October should be minimal in comparison as October marks the end of the growing season.","","CSV"

October, climatologically the driest month of the year anyway, fell even short of normal values at most locations in north and central Georgia.  Rainfall deficits of 15 to 20 inches were common in the north and rainfall deficits of 6 to 12 inches were common in central areas.     Most areas of the state had only received 30 to 40 percent of normal annual rainfall by the end of October.  Many lakes and rivers across north and central Georgia were nearing all time record low levels and above ground water supplies were being significantly impacted in many of the larger cities, especially Atlanta.  A number of stream gage locations on creeks and river in north and central Georgia had established new record low water levels during October, including the major river basins of the Coosa, Chattahoochee, upper Oconee, upper Ocmulgee and Flint. Significant water conservation measures were being implemented in many cities across north and central Georgia.||Note, the impact of the drought on crops and the estimated monetary damage was included with the September 2007 Storm Data.  Additional crop losses from September to October should be minimal in comparison as October marks the end of the growing season.","","CSV"

Strong surface instability, and gust fronts that developed from these storms, focused new shower and thunderstorm development, with several of these storms becoming severe. One longer lived severe thunderstorm developed over eastern Upshur County, then merged with another southward moving band of strong thunderstorms, producing widespread wind damage across eastern Upshur, much of Gregg, and northern Rusk County. The cities of Longview and Kilgore were hit hardest, with numerous trees blown down/uprooted, power lines downed, and trees falling onto homes, with at least one known injury reported.

D3 (extreme) drought conditions lasted around Lake Okeechobee until June 12th, with D2 (severe) drought conditions the remainder of the month. D2 drought conditions remained across Broward County until June 5th, eastern Palm Beach County until June 12th, and Collier County until June 19th when more consistent summer rains became more established across the area.||The level of Lake Okeechobee remained fairly steady, recovering only slightly from its low of 8.94 at the beginning of the month to 8.9 feet by June 29th. This slow change in the lake level resulted in a continuation of significant drought impacts for the general public, with water usage restrictions continuing across South Florida. Phase 3 restrictions (50 percent reduction in usage) were in place for Broward County and the Lake Okeechobee area, while the rest of South Florida was under Phase 2 restrictions (30 percent reduction). Wells across interior and western sections of South Florida were running at below 10 percent of normal, and underground reservoirs were also running below normal area-wide.||The extremely dry conditions along with gradually increasing  thunderstorm activity resulted in several new wildfires breaking out interior sections of South Florida. In addition, large wildfires which started in May at the Big Cypress National Preserve in Collier County and the Paterson Fire in Hendry County continued to burn into the first half of June. Over 65,000 acres were consumed between those two fires alone.","CSV"

Many vehicles were reported in the ditch, especially along Interstate 94 between Moorhead and Fergus Falls. 10 inches of snow was reported at Norcross, 9 inches near Battle Lake, and 7 inches at Ponsford, Wadena, and Wendell.","","CSV"

Damage was observed at the Three Rivers Muncipal Airport and at an adjacent residence to the airport. A hangar door was blown open at the airport, with 2 large tree trunks falling onto parked vehicles at a private residence. One of the vehicles had pulled into the driveway due to poor visbility, and before the driver could exit, the tree trunk fell onto the roof of the car, causing minor head injury to the driver. The Three Rivers AWOS (KHAI) recorded a 68 mph wind gust at 548 pm EDT. As the survey progressed along M-60 to some of the back roads, more extensive damage began to be encountered. A barn was found destroyed by a combination of the strong winds and a small shed being picked up and thrown into the barn. An adjacent barn also suffered moderate damage from the wind. Numerous trees limbs were snapped in the yard, as well as the chimney of the 2 story residence being blown over to roof level. Just to the north of this residence a large grove of various hardwood trees suffered extensive damage with many trees being uprooted or snapped. The sandy soil in the area reduced the resistance of the roots somewhat.  A residence as well as a barn suffered only minor damage despite the estimated 90 to 95 mph winds. KIWX 88D Base velocity data showed a couplet with 82 kt (94 mph) outbound winds in this general area. Damage continued northeast towards Mendon where trees continued to be damaged as well as 2 barns. |With the strength of the winds, it is possible that a few gust front tornadoes (gustnadoes) may have developed and helped locally focus some of the damage, but by far the strength of the straight line winds was more significant then the potential winds of any gustnadoes.","CSV"

D3 (extreme) drought conditions lasted around Lake Okeechobee until June 12th, with D2 (severe) drought conditions the remainder of the month. D2 drought conditions remained across Broward County until June 5th, eastern Palm Beach County until June 12th, and Collier County until June 19th when more consistent summer rains became more established across the area.||The level of Lake Okeechobee remained fairly steady, recovering only slightly from its low of 8.94 at the beginning of the month to 8.9 feet by June 29th. This slow change in the lake level resulted in a continuation of significant drought impacts for the general public, with water usage restrictions continuing across South Florida. Phase 3 restrictions (50 percent reduction in usage) were in place for Broward County and the Lake Okeechobee area, while the rest of South Florida was under Phase 2 restrictions (30 percent reduction). Wells across interior and western sections of South Florida were running at below 10 percent of normal, and underground reservoirs were also running below normal area-wide.||The extremely dry conditions along with gradually increasing  thunderstorm activity resulted in several new wildfires breaking out interior sections of South Florida.
